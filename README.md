## About

CEOs is an acronym for Check Events Online and Share
This was a project for the first year of university in a Web technologies and information systems.
For both of us, it was the first experience in creating an website with html, css and javascript.

The CE0s is a website where you can check events on a catalog, filter for keywords and other parameters, create an account and register for events. You can also check partnerships and testimonies.
